# FindaSpot Parking App - Efficent Parking
The FindaSpot app is designed for Seattleites like you and me, who are desperately searching for a parking spot to make it to that one meetup or the dinner reservation on Friday night. The goal was to create a site that is useful for all of us. FindaSpot is an ambitious idea and has many updates to come.
Liri can take in 4 commands:

# How to use FindaSpot - Two user options

1. Login or Register for an account.

2. User experiences:

- Clicking the FindaSpot button will direct the user to the Driver page. As a "Driver" you are able to find the most efficient place to park close to your current location or any destination (concerts, bars, friends/family, sporting events, any event) by searching the address through the Grab a Spot tab.

- Clicking the AddaSpot button will direct the user to the Owner application form. As a "Owner", you are able to make any privately owned parking spot available to rent to another user/drivers. 

- Owners may also view and manage all posted spots on the Owner Profile page.
